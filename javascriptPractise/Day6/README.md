# Array Methods

1) **Direct Methods- to string and modify it directly** 

```eg ) push,pop,shift,unshift,splice ```
``` ADDING STARTING => unshift
	ADDING ENDING   => push
	REMOVE START   => shift
	REMOVE END  	=> pop 

	SPLICE         => used to remove and modify array and also replace in b/w arrays with something different
```

2) **Methods Require results to store in New Variable**

```eg) concat , toString , slice.```
```
 concat => adds two or more string in one combined array 

tostring => all array element change into array - but keep it in variable to store and use & 

slice => returns the slice from an array into array-> store this too as this is also array data type and returned from another array  ```
