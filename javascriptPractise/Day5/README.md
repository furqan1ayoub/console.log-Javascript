# let & const
- In JavaScript, the key difference between const and let lies in their immutability:

## Using const for a constant value
```javascript
const PI = 3.14159; 
// PI cannot be reassigned later in the code
```

## Using let for a variable that might change
```javascript
let counter = 0; 
counter++; // The value of counter can be incremented

```
