# Basics of Dom 

```javascript
// Dom basics-> a strucutred representation of html element 
// it is a tree of nodes each node represents an element in html doc
// it is also a object having values and methods in it
//see ->  console.dir(window.document)
```
# IMPT
```javascript
// it is just kinda when browser loads the window object the html defined
// for the page goes into the doc
// then we can manipulate it basis dynamically 
// & yeah i.e the reason -> we write script tag at last in html
// cause we want to load -> all elements in Document object first
// then javascript code to manipulate it

// like if any heading isn't there loaded yet in document
// Javascript logic can't be applied to it
