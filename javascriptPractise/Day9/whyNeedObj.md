#  Objects Group Related Data Together
### Without objects, we would need multiple separate variables, which makes the code harder to manage.

üî¥ Without an object:

```javascript
let name = "John";
let age = 25;
let job = "Hacker";

function introduce(name, age, job) {
    return `Hi, I'm ${name}, a ${age}-year-old ${job}.`;
}

console.log(introduce(name, age, job));
üí° This works but can get messy if you need to track multiple people.
```
üü¢ With an object:
```javascript
let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 25,
    job: "Hacker",
    introduce: function() {
        return `Hi, I'm ${this.name}, a ${this.age}-year-old ${this.job}.`;
    }
};

console.log(person.introduce()); 
```
# ‚úÖ Why is this better?
```
- All related properties (name, age, job) are inside one structure (person).
- Functions (introduce()) are inside too, making it reusable for different people.
```

1Ô∏è‚É£ Objects store multiple related values together.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Functions inside objects are called methods.

3Ô∏è‚É£ this refers to the current object.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Use dot notation (.) to access properties and call methods.
