# Understand -> prompt return always string
**We change it with parsInt(strinName)**
## Important
- **isNan** -> *return true if it finds the data is string
- **! (Logical Not)** -> *inverses true to false*
- **else will always be executed if it is not a number**

`so if data in the question is string it although should return true but due to ! inverse it to false & our code of else will run`
